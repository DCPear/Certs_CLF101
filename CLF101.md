|Cloud Deployment|<li> 100% IT infrastructure on the cloud <li>All applications migrated to or created in the cloud <li> Removes roadblock of costly and time-consuming procument processes|
|On-Premises/Private Cloud Deployment| <li> Use virtualization to deploy resources in their on-premises data centers <li>Often looks like traditional IT infrastructure <li> Does not provide a lot of benefits of cloud computing <li> Resources cannot be accessed using the internet <li> Security: provides dedicated resources <br> <sub><sup> The setup does not provide a lot of benefits of cloud computing. The resources are not accessed using the internet because they are on-site. This means you can access them really quickly because nothing has to be uploaded or downloaded using the internet. However, it could utilize application management and virtualization technologies to increase efficiency of the available resources, such as by deploying virtual machines and internet resources behind a firewall. On-premises deployment provides dedicated resources which means that the organization is not sharing any part of their resources with another organization. This may be a requirement for certain industries that take data privacy very seriously, such as the medical field.</sub></sup>|
|Hybrid Cloud Deployment|<li> Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources <li> Great for established companies that are in the process of migrating over the cloud. Hybrid deployment allows organizations to extend and scale their infrastructure into the cloud while still maintaining access to on-premises resources living on on-site servers|
|Cloud computing-design priciples <br> 5 best practices | build the most secure, durable, efficient, and high-performing IT infrastructure possible </br> How? <li>avoid unnecessary costs </br> by using only what you need, turning off unused servers, Reserving resources in advance, contnuous monitoring <li> Reliability ( A reliable system has the ability to recover from service disruptions often by itself) </br>by dynamically adjusting computing resources at demand,testing your disaster recovery settings and incorporating redundancies in your infrastructure (Redundancy refers to the concept of having duplicate copies of resources so that when one goes down the other can take over to provide seamless cut over experience for end users) <li> Efficiency  </br> Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources to adjust to system requirements. It should allow for more experimentation and when a change is set in motion, should be able to go global in minutes <li> infrastructure security <br>  This includes security of information, systems, and assets. Security best practices should be automated. Data should be protected in transit and at rest, which means when it's being moved from one location to another, as well as when it's being stored. Traceability should be enabled, along with strong identity foundation.  in case of a security breach, you are able to see who did what at any point, because every user has a unique user account or access key. Who can do and access what should be well defined and followed <li> Operational excellence <br> by improving ability to run and monitor systems while constantly improving processes and procedures. Everything should be documented and operational procedures should be frequently refined. Failures should be anticipated and learned from, and systems and processes updated to take them into account. If an incident occurs, such as a major service downtime, the whole team should come together to discuss what went wrong, how it could have been prevented, and set up procedures in case it happens again.|

|AWS history|<li>Amazon.com Web Service launched in 2002 <li> Amazon was planning to launch Merchant.com - an ecommerce platform to third-party shops <li> The platform paved the way for Amazon <li> The platform paved the way for Amazon to evolve from "online store" to "service company" </br> AWS </br> <li> a decade and a half old <li> Growing exponentally every year  <li> Over 1 millian active customers <li> 10% of Amazon's revenue came from AWS in 2017 |
|What is AWS?| <li> AWS offers IT infrastructure services to businesses and organizations as web services to help them scale and grow efficiently. <li> AWS provides what used to be purchased as hardware, such as network switches and servers, as resources to be accessed using the internet. <li> Because of cloud computing's pay as you go model and robust resources, organizations are able to save time, money, and human resources by moving their resources to AWS. </br> AWS Services by Groups <br>As of winter 2020, there are 24 groups of services offered by the platform ranging from compute to storage to game development. Each group contains anywhere between one to 12 services with more being added all the time. You can host your static files using simple stores service, host a WordPress blog using elastic compute cloud, send emails using work mail, stream desktops using workspaces or create games using game lift. <br>It's probably not far from the truth to say that your imagination is the limit for what you can potentially architect and create using Amazon Web Services. </br>As a cloud computing service provider, AWS boasts flexibility, scalability, and reliability alongside affordability that was impossible with traditional on premises IT infrastructure. With AWS, engineers can concentrate on building your products and features instead of worrying about the it infrastructure's ability to handle their scaling. </br> [<img src="AWS services by Groups.png" width="250"/>](the-internet.png)|
