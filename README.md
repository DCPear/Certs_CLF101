The resources are not accessed using the internet because they are on-site. This means you can access them really quickly because nothing has to be uploaded or downloaded using the internet. However, it could utilize application management and virtualization technologies to increase efficiency of the available resources, such as by deploying virtual machines and internet resources behind a firewall. On-premises deployment provides dedicated resources which means that the organization is not sharing any part of their resources with another organization. This may be a requirement for certain industries that take data privacy very seriously, such as the medical field.</sub></sup>|
|Hybrid Cloud Deployment|<li> Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources <li> Great for established companies that are in the process of migrating over the cloud. Hybrid deployment allows organizations to extend and scale their infrastructure into the cloud while still maintaining access to on-premises resources living on on-site servers|
|Cloud computing-design priciples <br> 5 best practices | build the most secure, durable, efficient, and high-performing IT infrastructure possible </br> How? <li>avoid unnecessary costs </br> by using only what you need, turning off unused servers, Reserving resources in advance, contnuous monitoring <li> Reliability ( A reliable system has the ability to recover from service disruptions often by itself) </br>by dynamically adjusting computing resources at demand,testing your disaster recovery settings and incorporating redundancies in your infrastructure (Redundancy refers to the concept of having duplicate copies of resources so that when one goes down the other can take over to provide seamless cut over experience for end users) <li> Efficiency  </br> Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources to adjust to system requirements. It should allow for more experimentation and when a change is set in motion, should be able to go global in minutes <li> infrastructure security <br>  This includes security of information, systems, and assets. Security best practices should be automated. Data should be protected in transit and at rest, which means when it's being moved from one location to another, as well as when it's being stored. Traceability should be enabled, along with strong identity foundation.  in case of a security breach, you are able to see who did what at any point, because every user has a unique user account or access key. Who can do and access what should be well defined and followed <li> Operational excellence <br> by improving ability to run and monitor systems while constantly improving processes and procedures. Everything should be documented and operational procedures should be frequently refined. Failures should be anticipated and learned from, and systems and processes updated to take them into account. If an incident occurs, such as a major service downtime, the whole team should come together to discuss what went wrong, how it could have been prevented, and set up procedures in case it happens again.|

|AWS history|<li>Amazon.com Web Service launched in 2002 <li> Amazon was planning to launch Merchant.com - an ecommerce platform to third-party shops <li> The platform paved the way for Amazon <li> The platform paved the way for Amazon to evolve from "online store" to "service company" </br> AWS </br> <li> a decade and a half old <li> Growing exponentally every year  <li> Over 1 millian active customers <li> 10% of Amazon's revenue came from AWS in 2017 |
|What is AWS?| <li> AWS offers IT infrastructure services to businesses and organizations as web services to help them scale and grow efficiently. <li> AWS provides what used to be purchased as hardware, such as network switches and servers, as resources to be accessed using the internet. <li> Because of cloud computing's pay as you go model and robust resources, organizations are able to save time, money, and human resources by moving their resources to AWS. </br> AWS Services by Groups <br>As of winter 2020, there are 24 groups of services offered by the platform ranging from compute to storage to game development. Each group contains anywhere between one to 12 services with more being added all the time. You can host your static files using simple stores service, host a WordPress blog using elastic compute cloud, send emails using work mail, stream desktops using workspaces or create games using game lift. <br>It's probably not far from the truth to say that your imagination is the limit for what you can potentially architect and create using Amazon Web Services. </br>As a cloud computing service provider, AWS boasts flexibility, scalability, and reliability alongside affordability that was impossible with traditional on premises IT infrastructure. With AWS, engineers can concentrate on building your products and features instead of worrying about the it infrastructure's ability to handle their scaling. </br> [<img src="AWS services by Groups.png" width="350"/>](the-internet.png)|

## Core Services - Compute
| Key word     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Technology domain| Four parts </br> <li> Define methods of deploying and operating in the AWS Cloud <li> Define the AWS global infrastructure <li>Identify the core AWS services <li>Identify resources for technology support.|
|EC2|Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. it's one of the most widely used services in the AWS. Amazon EC2 allows you to launch applications and servers when you need them without upfront financial commitments. It's integrated with many other AWS services, is reliable and secure, and allows you or your company to quickly and inexpensively spin up instances of virtual servers for all of your different needs.<li>Virtual server running on AWS <li> Configurabl by number of virtual CPUs, GBs of RAM, size/type of storage, and network speed <li>Only charged for what you use, when you use it <li> Deploy extremely scalable and reliable virtual servers within minutes |
|Elastic Beanstalk| If you're constantly frustrated by the amount of time you spend managing configuring servers, databases, firewalls and networks, perhaps its time you give AWS Elastic Beanstalk a try <li>Handles the deployment process, including the capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling and application health monitoring. <li> You can upload services developed using JAVA, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go and Docker <li> You retain control over resources at all times <li>  it's free to use and you only pay for the AWS resources needed to store and run the web applications you've deployed. <li> It automatically scales your applications up and down based on its specific needs. <li> complete freedom to select the AWS resources such as the EC2 Instance type that you want to use for your application <li> Allows manual management of infrastructure|
| Elastic Beanstalk vs EC2|EC2 is Amazon's service that allows you to create a server (AWS calls these instances) in the AWS cloud. You pay by the hour and only what you use. You can do whatever you want with this instance as well as launch n number of instances. Elastic Beanstalk is one layer of abstraction away from the EC2 layer. |
|Elastic Load Balancing| Elastic load balancers are highly available, secure, flexible, and monitorable allowing you to glean robust information about your traffic as well as providing you the confidence that your applications are up at all times. </br>Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. (so no single server is overloaded) <li>It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. (Fault-tolerant) n<li> Scalable and secure  </br> <b> 3 types of elastic Load Balancing </b></br> Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. Amazon ECS services can use these types of load balancer. Application Load Balancers are used to route HTTP/HTTPS (or Layer 7) traffic.|
|Lambda| <li> Runs code (Lambda function) in response to an event . eg: user uploading an image  into an S3 bucket. user tapping a button on your mobile app to buy an item <li> Automatically runs uploaded code and scales applications <li> Pay only for the ode is running and each event trigger <li> No need to provision and maintain servers |
|Lightsail|Amazon Lightsail is a virtual private server (VPS) provider and is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers, small businesses, students, and other users who need a solution to build and host their applications on cloud (quick development or test environment spun up) <li>designed to scale, scalable with your project's growth <li>cost effective monthly fees <li> use it to deploy simple web applications, create websites, run your business's software, or spin up developer or test environments <li>User-friendly  one-click-to-launch services without engineering know-how<li> There are many preconfigured and ready-to-use operating systems, web apps, and development stacks.  eg : WordPress, Windows OS, Ubuntu and Node.js|
|Deploying and operating in AWS|AWS users can manage and deploy resources in the AWS cloud in three ways <li> AWS Management Console <li> AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI) <li> AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) |
|AWS Management Console| <li> Graphical interface that supports most AWS services <li> Can access billing statements, launch new services, check out health of web apps, and so on. <li> User-friendly and easy to navigate |
|AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI)|<li> Access AWS services via the command line <li> Command line: access and change resources via text-based command entry <li> Programming language agnostic </br> eg: service to shut down, or add new file to an S3 bucket|
|AWS SDKs| <li> Incorporate connectivity and functionality of a wide range of AWS services into your code <li> Deploy AWS services and resources using a variety of popular programming languages <li> Use AWS resources in exisitng applications </br> eg: The AWS SDK for Java simpliﬁes use of AWS Services by providing a set of libraries that are consistent and familiar for Java developers. It provides support for API lifecycle consideration such as credential management, retries, data marshaling, and serialization|
|CLI vs SDK|AWS CLI's and SDK's allow you to create tools that are specific to your organization, and help create an environment that utilize infrastructure as code. With infrastructure as code, you can write code that describes the configurations for specific AWS Cloud services, and they can be deployed for you by AWS. It helps to speed up the deployment process, and removes the risk of human error when spinning up new resources. Some AWS Cloud services that utilize infrastructure as code are Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, and AWS CloudFormation.|
|AWS Global infrastructure| <ol> <li>Availability Zones (AZs) </br> - AWS data centers around the world </br> - Completely independent of each other in network and power source </br> - Currently almost six dozen Availability Zones (AZs) around the world  <li> Regions </br> - Made up of two or more Availability Zones </br> - Currently two dozen AWS Regions around the world. </br> <sup>When a brand new service is introduced, it's generally first introduced in a few specific regions as opposed to the whole world. Some of the regions that receive new services earlier are US East North Virginia, US West North California, some Asia Pacific regions like Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo, and some areas in the European Union like Frankfurt and Ireland. This fact may influence which region you decide to use to host your infrastructure.</br></br> Generally, you would choose a region closest to your physical location to host your AWS cloud infrastructure, because you can reduce network latency for your end users </br></br>  Some regions cost more than others. And service level agreements, or SLAs, also vary by region. </br></br> You may also have compliance requirements to meet, which may require you to host your resources in specific regions or multiple regions. Hosting your resources in multiple availability zones, or even regions, help create what is known as high availability</sup></ol> |
|High Availability| <li> <sup>Highly avaialble resources may have duplicate copies in multiple Availability Zones or even Regions</sup> <li> <sup>Resiliency: Ability to provide uninterrupted performace. even during natural disasters</sup> <li> <sup>Redundancy: Having multiple copies of data in different data centers</sup> <li> <sup>Architect your AWS Cloud infrastruture to protect against downtimes caused by natural disasters or power outages</sup>|

|Snowball| AWS Snowball is one of the very few hardware solutions from AWS<li>it is a data migration tool. <li> AWS will physically ship you a Snowball to move your data onto, and then mail it back so you can migrate huge amounts of data. <li>  The amount of data you can move into AWS Cloud ranges from 50 terabytes with regular Snowball up to 100 petabytes with a Snowmobile, a 45-foot-long ruggedized shipping container pulled by a semi-trailer truck <li> Usage fee: free for 10 days of onsite usage; extra usage for every extra day you keep it. <li> Service fee per job starting at $200 <li> Storage fee: storge fee for data transferred into s3 (but no transfer fee) <li> Snomobile: expensive!|
|How snowball works|<img src="snowball.png" width="150"/> </br> For large amounts of data, the transfer up to the cloud could take months, even with a high speed Internet connection. With AWS Snowball the same transfer can be accomplished in less than a week using two Snowball devices, with a few days tacked on for shipping|
|Storage Gateway| Basically, it creates a gate that connects your on-site users and devices to the resources stored in AWS Cloud with minimal latency.</br> <img src="HybridStorageSolution.png" width="150"/> </br>  It connects your on-premises storage with AWS Cloud Storage, providing a hybrid storage solution for your IT infrastructure. The service seamlessly integrates on-premises enterprise applications and corporate workflows with AWS's Cloud Storage Services through the use of a virtual machine installed onto an on-premises data centers host server. </br> AWS offers three types of Storage solutuions to fit your needs </br> <li> File based <li> Volume based <li>Tape based|
|AWS Storage Gateway: File Gateway| <li> Files stored as objects in S3 <li> 1:1 representation of each file <li> Asynchronously updates objects to S3 as local files are updated <li> Local cache to provide low-latency access to recently accessed files|

|CloudFront| We want things fast, digital or physical, and we want them now. On the Internet, content delivery networks or CDNs are working behind the scenes to deliver your content faster and faster. Amazon's global CDN service that securely delivers data, applications, and APIs is called Amazon CloudFront. <li> CloudFront is a global content delivery network (CDN) <li>Based on location of the user, origin of the website/application, location of the content delivery server <li> Integrates with many AWS services to provide optimal performance and security <li> Makes loading websites/apps for end users faster using edge locations to cache files and resources  <li> scalable </br> <img src="cache.png" width="150"/></br> Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as . html, . css, . js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge location </br></br>  In AWS, files and data are cached at edge locations. Once the data is downloaded to an edge location it stays there for a certain period of time at which point users near the data center can retrieve the webpages or application resources from the edge location close to their location rather than having to go all the way to the origin which could even be on a different continent. This allows for data to be retrieved faster with the best possible performance because users are not going all the way back to the origin server to download the resources but rather accessing a location close to themselves |

You can create a workflow to add a specific policy to an S3 bucket, when CloudTrail finds API call that made the bucket public. You track many account activities, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, and command-line tools. You can review logs using CloudTrail event history. Have the reports delivered to S3 buckets or send reports to CloudWatch logs and events for more granular monitoring of AWS resources. You can view, filter, and download account activities for the most recent 90 days for free. You can also, set up a trail that delivers a copy of management events in every region free of charge. However, the data is sent to S3 so you will be charged for storage usage. Data events, which are operations performed on, or within the resources itself also have very small charges. AWS CloudTrail is an invaluable resource in simplifying events security analysis and troubleshooting for your AWS cloud IT infrastructure.</sub>|
|CloudWatch|<sub>You've built your app or your infrastructure. But now you need to actively monitor it and collect metrics and react to any events. Unfortunately, you can't be up 24/7 monitoring and neither can your team. Thankfully, Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and management system built for developers, system administrators, site-reliability engineers, and IT managers. Natively integrated with over 70 AWS services, CloudWatch helps you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance and operational health. It collects monitoring and operational data as logs, metrics and events to provide insight into your application performances. You can collect and track metrics in real time or have it send off notifications when an event occurs. You can even set up CloudWatch alarms to automatically make changes using pre-defined triggers so you don't have to lift a finger to fix common issues. CloudWatch employs a pay-as-you-go model so you only pay for what you use with no up-front commitment. Keep tabs on your applications hosted on AWS Cloud with Amazon CloudWatch so you and your teammates can get a good night sleep instead of holding round-the-clock monitoring vigils.</sub>|

|Types of charges|Pay-As-Yo-Go Model of Cloud Computing <li> No huge upfront costs <li> Billed only for the resources consumed <li> Easily scale resources up or down to suit business needs</br>The three fundamental drivers of costs with AWS are: </br> compute, storage, and outbound data transfer|
|1. Compute|<li> pay hourly from the time you launch a resource until the time you terminate it. <li> EC2 (virtual server): Pay for the length of time the server is up and running|
|2. Storage| <li> For data stores or transfer, you typically pay per gigabyte. </br> An example would be storing profile images uploaded to your app for a social media application on the Cloud. You'll pay more if you have more users uploading images because you're using more space. <li>  S3 (storage service): Upload photos into an app and pay for the storage used|
|Outbound Data Transfer|<li>Pay to transfer data AWS <li> Usually no charge for data into AWS (inbound) or data transfers between other AWS services (in other words between s3 and EC2) within the same region. </br> eg:  This could be your social media application, saving the profile images to the storage service, once the user clicks upload inside the app. </br> <u>Different services uses different pricing models</u> </br> <sub>For example, S3 AWS's storage service utilizes different prices by storage types. The most basic S3 storage type is the S3 Standard Storage. This storage type is the most expensive storage type because it boasts high availability and extremely low chances of data corruption. Even better, you can retrieve the data immediately. Compare this with S3 Glacier Storage, which is substantially cheaper, buffered a much lower price you must wait longer for the data to be retrieved and the availability is not as high. As a result the S3 Standard Storage is well suited for objects you will use often, like images live on a website, whereas S3 Glacier Storage will be better suited for backups of data for safekeeping. While S3 has different prices by storage types Aurora AWS has database service charges for storage and data input, and outpu</sub> </br> <img src="storage.png" width="150"/></br><img src="aurora.png" width="150"/>|

You can find this one at calculator.aws. And it helps you estimate the cost of a cloud architecture solution you're looking to build. You would add services and configurations to the calculator, which would provide a report with estimated totals per service, service group, and total infrastructure. You can utilize this service to compare service costs per region, reduce your EC2 spend, find the right EC2 instance for your needs, or estimate your overall AWS cloud spend. Cost Explorer is an AWS tool that enables you to view and analyze your cost in usage, forecast how much you'd likely spend, or get recommendations for what reserved instances to purchase to minimize costs. The Cost Explorer is part of the Billing and Cost Management Console dashboard. The pay-as-you-go model is one of the largest allures of moving your IT infrastructure into the cloud</sub>|
|AWS Free Tier| <sub>he AWS Free Tier allows potential customers to test out and become comfortable with many services offered by AWS Cloud for free. Most of the offers expire after 12 months, at which point you'll be charged for the services you consume at regular rates. As you near the expiration date of the Free Tier, you'll get a notification from AWS. You are then responsible for manually turning down or deleting the services for which you don't want to be charged. You can find the Free Tier offerings by going to AWS.Amazon.com/free. Here, you'll notice that AWS has over 60 services available for use separated into three different types of offers. The three types of offers in AWS Free Tier are always free, 12 months free, and trials. First option is always free, which, as you might guess, shows services that are always free to use up to a certain point. There are generally usage limits after which point you must pay to use these services. The second option is 12 months free. These services are free for use, also generally up to a certain usage limit, for 12 months after your initial sign-up date. Some of the common uses limitations are use time, number of requests, amount of storage, number of characters, and number of actions per month. Once you go above a usage limit, you'll be charged for the service you use, even if you're still within the first 12 months. The final type of Free Tier offerings are trials. Most of the trials are for less than 12 months and have stricter usage limits. The common limitations are use time, use of space or number of requests. The AWS Free Tier is a great opportunity to test out and learn about many of the core services that power the AWS Cloud, and I highly recommend that you go take advantage of the different offers.</sub>|
