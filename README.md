The resources are not accessed using the internet because they are on-site. This means you can access them really quickly because nothing has to be uploaded or downloaded using the internet. However, it could utilize application management and virtualization technologies to increase efficiency of the available resources, such as by deploying virtual machines and internet resources behind a firewall. On-premises deployment provides dedicated resources which means that the organization is not sharing any part of their resources with another organization. This may be a requirement for certain industries that take data privacy very seriously, such as the medical field.</sub></sup>|
|Hybrid Cloud Deployment|<li> Connects on-premises technology with cloud-based resources <li> Great for established companies that are in the process of migrating over the cloud. Hybrid deployment allows organizations to extend and scale their infrastructure into the cloud while still maintaining access to on-premises resources living on on-site servers|
|Cloud computing-design priciples <br> 5 best practices | build the most secure, durable, efficient, and high-performing IT infrastructure possible </br> How? <li>avoid unnecessary costs </br> by using only what you need, turning off unused servers, Reserving resources in advance, contnuous monitoring <li> Reliability ( A reliable system has the ability to recover from service disruptions often by itself) </br>by dynamically adjusting computing resources at demand,testing your disaster recovery settings and incorporating redundancies in your infrastructure (Redundancy refers to the concept of having duplicate copies of resources so that when one goes down the other can take over to provide seamless cut over experience for end users) <li> Efficiency  </br> Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources to adjust to system requirements. It should allow for more experimentation and when a change is set in motion, should be able to go global in minutes <li> infrastructure security <br>  This includes security of information, systems, and assets. Security best practices should be automated. Data should be protected in transit and at rest, which means when it's being moved from one location to another, as well as when it's being stored. Traceability should be enabled, along with strong identity foundation.  in case of a security breach, you are able to see who did what at any point, because every user has a unique user account or access key. Who can do and access what should be well defined and followed <li> Operational excellence <br> by improving ability to run and monitor systems while constantly improving processes and procedures. Everything should be documented and operational procedures should be frequently refined. Failures should be anticipated and learned from, and systems and processes updated to take them into account. If an incident occurs, such as a major service downtime, the whole team should come together to discuss what went wrong, how it could have been prevented, and set up procedures in case it happens again.|

|AWS history|<li>Amazon.com Web Service launched in 2002 <li> Amazon was planning to launch Merchant.com - an ecommerce platform to third-party shops <li> The platform paved the way for Amazon <li> The platform paved the way for Amazon to evolve from "online store" to "service company" </br> AWS </br> <li> a decade and a half old <li> Growing exponentally every year  <li> Over 1 millian active customers <li> 10% of Amazon's revenue came from AWS in 2017 |
|What is AWS?| <li> AWS offers IT infrastructure services to businesses and organizations as web services to help them scale and grow efficiently. <li> AWS provides what used to be purchased as hardware, such as network switches and servers, as resources to be accessed using the internet. <li> Because of cloud computing's pay as you go model and robust resources, organizations are able to save time, money, and human resources by moving their resources to AWS. </br> AWS Services by Groups <br>As of winter 2020, there are 24 groups of services offered by the platform ranging from compute to storage to game development. Each group contains anywhere between one to 12 services with more being added all the time. You can host your static files using simple stores service, host a WordPress blog using elastic compute cloud, send emails using work mail, stream desktops using workspaces or create games using game lift. <br>It's probably not far from the truth to say that your imagination is the limit for what you can potentially architect and create using Amazon Web Services. </br>As a cloud computing service provider, AWS boasts flexibility, scalability, and reliability alongside affordability that was impossible with traditional on premises IT infrastructure. With AWS, engineers can concentrate on building your products and features instead of worrying about the it infrastructure's ability to handle their scaling. </br> [<img src="AWS services by Groups.png" width="350"/>](the-internet.png)|

|EC2|Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. it's one of the most widely used services in the AWS. Amazon EC2 allows you to launch applications and servers when you need them without upfront financial commitments. It's integrated with many other AWS services, is reliable and secure, and allows you or your company to quickly and inexpensively spin up instances of virtual servers for all of your different needs.<li>Virtual server running on AWS <li> Configurabl by number of virtual CPUs, GBs of RAM, size/type of storage, and network speed <li>Only charged for what you use, when you use it <li> Deploy extremely scalable and reliable virtual servers within minutes |
|Elastic Beanstalk| If you're constantly frustrated by the amount of time you spend managing configuring servers, databases, firewalls and networks, perhaps its time you give AWS Elastic Beanstalk a try <li>Handles the deployment process, including the capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling and application health monitoring. <li> You can upload services developed using JAVA, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go and Docker <li> You retain control over resources at all times <li>  it's free to use and you only pay for the AWS resources needed to store and run the web applications you've deployed. <li> It automatically scales your applications up and down based on its specific needs. <li> complete freedom to select the AWS resources such as the EC2 Instance type that you want to use for your application <li> Allows manual management of infrastructure|
| Elastic Beanstalk vs EC2|EC2 is Amazon's service that allows you to create a server (AWS calls these instances) in the AWS cloud. You pay by the hour and only what you use. You can do whatever you want with this instance as well as launch n number of instances. Elastic Beanstalk is one layer of abstraction away from the EC2 layer. |
|Elastic Load Balancing| Elastic load balancers are highly available, secure, flexible, and monitorable allowing you to glean robust information about your traffic as well as providing you the confidence that your applications are up at all times. </br>Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. (so no single server is overloaded) <li>It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. (Fault-tolerant) n<li> Scalable and secure  </br> <b> 3 types of elastic Load Balancing </b></br> Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. Amazon ECS services can use these types of load balancer. Application Load Balancers are used to route HTTP/HTTPS (or Layer 7) traffic.|
|Lambda| <li> Runs code (Lambda function) in response to an event . eg: user uploading an image  into an S3 bucket. user tapping a button on your mobile app to buy an item <li> Automatically runs uploaded code and scales applications <li> Pay only for the ode is running and each event trigger <li> No need to provision and maintain servers |
|Lightsail|Amazon Lightsail is a virtual private server (VPS) provider and is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers, small businesses, students, and other users who need a solution to build and host their applications on cloud (quick development or test environment spun up) <li>designed to scale, scalable with your project's growth <li>cost effective monthly fees <li> use it to deploy simple web applications, create websites, run your business's software, or spin up developer or test environments <li>User-friendly  one-click-to-launch services without engineering know-how<li> There are many preconfigured and ready-to-use operating systems, web apps, and development stacks.  eg : WordPress, Windows OS, Ubuntu and Node.js|
